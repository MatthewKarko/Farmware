## ELEC3609 Group 11

## Mission
Farmware services the need for a digitised regulatory compliance aid—it provides an interface for farm admins and workers to collect
and manage the required data for Freshcare standards. Farmware can further leverage this data to power business intelligence and provide
deep insight into the farm’s practices to assist decisions.
